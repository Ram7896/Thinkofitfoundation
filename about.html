						<p>WHY SHOULD YOU JOIN THE YOUTH LEADERSHIP PROGRAM?

What’s in it for me? A question that must be lingering upon your mind, fret not because we value your precious time and thought process more than you can imagine.

    Before you are a leader,
    success is all about
    Growing Yourself.
    When you become a leader,
    success is all about
    Growing Others.
    Jack Welch in Winning, 2005

These truly profound words by Jack Welch summarize what you gain by investing your time and letting us nurture your efforts into meaningful attempts at changing the world.

The Youth Leadership Program is about equipping you with the skill set required to be a leader while ensuring your growth. You will get a chance to collaborate with the young leaders of our nation. We believe that you are capable of being mature and understanding and that leadership doesn’t necessarily have much to do with age.</p>

						<h3>COURSE OF PROGRAM</h3>

<p>During the course of your involvement in THINK OF IT – Youth Leadership Program, you’ll be involved in various activities related to your city chapters. These activities are not limited to conferences, programs/ discussions on policy making and problem solving which involves working with the local politicians, officials involved and TOI – City Chapter VPs and Managers.

Our major emphasis rests on hands-on experience and practical knowledge rather than merely being a platform for dialogue. The time has come to uphold actions over words.

We encourage youth to be a part of the summits representing them like The Youth Parliament and The State Conferences hosted bi-annually to bring the leader within them in front of eminent persona’s whose experiences offer a lot to learn about politics, governance and the world.

There are city chapters which the youth can partake in after registering and discuss matters related to their cities. The promotions and other managerial positions will be filled on the merit of performance. Hence, your efforts will never be in vain. Your involvement in the decision-making process is our topmost priority because leadership can only be effective when there is equal participation. All in all, we expect you to hone as well as learn leadership skills throughout your journey with us.

You have an opportunity to be at the forefront to bring change into the country. You will get to assess problems and carve out unique solutions. Your voice matters to us more than anything else. Experience the cultural and universal diversity through youth forums, city chapters, clusters, state conferences, and national conferences. Lead a team, create your network among local leaders, politicians, personalities known to form a sway/ known to create an impact.</p>

						<p>Poverty, hunger, education problems, unemployment, environmental degradation, ill-treatment of animals and wildlife species, and a long list of ignored critical problems require immediate attention. It’s an irony to call ourselves a democracy when people are slowly forgetting its true meaning. It’s preferable to succumb to divisive politics rather than paying heed to issues that make life difficult for the poor and destitute.

The Environmental, political, social, and economic crisis is leading us to doomsday. We have still not elevated to the stage of assessing these problems; on how adverse their effects can be. We chose our goals of establishing differences rather than taking the first step and being a helping hand to those around us. Empathy is a long lost value that the youth must work together to re-incorporate into the society.

TOI-YLP attempts to mirror every aspect to you: directing and leading you to the root, motivating you to work upon a quick response to urgent problems. Sometimes, it’s impossible to decipher the regulations and bills however as a team, you are capable of unimaginable change. All the issues in our society need ‘Empowered Energetic Enthusiasts’ and the youth can think as well as suggest without preconceived notions. The youth has many opportunities in the world to explore, to drive their life in all modes they wish to, with all terrains of emotions to unearth.

Our sole remains to see a nation led by the youth. There is a need to incorporate unique mindsets in all spheres. It’s imperative to have a straightforward group of leaders laying down the terra firma to sustain the future. We hope to invigorate determination in able individuals and provide them with a clear path and vision through our various programs.Modern methodologies could be more effectively used to overpower current problems; issues considered insignificant could be unraveled. Interaction will take place and maximum indulgence can be taken care of by the youth. The vibe of each city and the whole nation could change with cultural activities, sports, events, and other active and hyper-active initiatives.

The pre-requisite to leadership is the ability to empathy and understanding. Even though our main emphasis is on the prior skill, we pay equal importance to the latter values without which even top most leaders would fail. Leadership doesn’t merely come from authority. The benefits for you are numerous if you possess a flair for indignant hard work because no change is achieved overnight. You will learn both soft and practical skills that are required to be heard and get your opinions through.

Our vision of society is an amalgam of ideas and change. If we can think of it, so can you! We believe that there is a hidden potential inside each of us, especially the youth and we invite you to explore it with us. </p>
